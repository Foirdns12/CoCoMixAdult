Brief instructions using CoCoMix on a data set (here: adult data frame)


1.reading in data: (path in example: data->adult.py)
UCI adult data set is available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult

PATH: Path of file
FEATURES: List of feature variables for the model/explanations
VAR_TYPES: List of variable type per variable (c,u,o)
COLUMNS: List of columns of the data set
CATEGORICAL/NUMERICAL: Lists of the categorical & numeric features
(_DROP: Writing down features to drop)

-load_df(columns=None, fillna="mean"):
param columns: List of columns to keep
param fillna: If not False, method to replace NaNs in numerical columns.
return: pd.DataFrame with the specified columns

-load_data(features=None, target="obj_purchasePrice", fillna="mean"):
param features: List of columns to use as features
param target: Name of column to use as the target
param fillna: see `load_df` for details
return: Samples as np.ndarray of size (n_samples, n_features),
             Targets as np.ndarray of size (n_samples,)
    

2.demonstration_adult_data for preparing data:
All data used in the demonstration is loaded through this module
to ensure consistency in the features, their type, and their order.
TARGET = Target variable
UNORDERED_CATEGORICAL_VALUES: unordererd categorical features and their values
ORDERED_CATEGORICAL_VALUES: ordered categorical features and their values
RANDOM STATE: to anchor sample
TRAIN_SIZE: relative share of training data in total data [0;1] for splitting data in training- & test data set

3. demonstration_data:
here the prepared data of the respective Use Case, which one would like to work on (here: demonstration_adult_data) are handed over
import data from adult / demonstration_adult_data and fit some configurations

####Model####

Model: AI Model for the data set (here: adult_rf)
save the model

####DENSITY ESTIMATION###
Estimating bandwidths:

-estimate_numerical_bandwidths_adult.py for deciding bw for numerical variables
try out different bw's and create a plot to select best fitting bandwidth


-estimate_categorial_bandwidths.py for deciding bw for categorical variables
try out different bw's and create a plot to select best fitting bandwidth:


finally,
bandwidths_adult.py for PDF:
FINAL_BANDWIDTHS: writing down the bandwidths of categorical variables

####transition_matrices####

configurations like alpha/mu/lambda/beta

####compute foils###
compute_foil_adult
this file is there for final use case configurations with methods to find the foils for the adult data frame with the CoCoMix algorithm

conf_parametrization_use_case(fact_sample, df_train, transition_matrices, boundaries):
numeric variables to Scalar with bw's & boundaries.
Categorical variables with transition matrices

compute_adult_cocomix
finale file to calculate foils out of the test sample & save those
prepare data (import df_train & df_test)
load model and matrices
set configurations


Besides the example there are many more methods/variations for use case specifications
